# Installation Guide and Requirements

Our anatomical and electrophysiological analyses were performed using custom-written scripts in Python and MATLAB.

The general methodology is detailed in the **Methods** section of the paper (to be updated soon).

We provide example datasets and analysis scripts for each type of analysis. The following software environments were tested:

## Image Analysis

To perform image analysis, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **JupyterLab 4**
- **Python 3** (Miniconda3, version 4.10.3)
- **Scikit-Image 0.23**

To replicate the exact environment used in our analysis, refer to the [`skimage-dev.yml`](./image_analysis/skimage-dev.yml) file for installation instructions.

## Nerve Signal Analysis

For nerve signal analysis, we used:

- **MATLAB 2024a** (with the Signal Processing Toolbox)

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed before running the provided scripts.
