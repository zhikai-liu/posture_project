# Installation tips and requirements
Anatomical and electrophysiological analysis were carried out using custom-written codes in Python and Matlab, respectively.

The general approach was described in the method section of the paper (updated soon):

Example datasets and example analysis codes are provided for each analysis. The following softwares were tested:

## Image analysis:
1. JupyterLab 4
2. Python 3 (miniconda3/4.10.3)
3. Scikit-image 0.23

To create the same environment needed for the analysis, please use skimage-dev.yml as a reference for installation.


## Nerve signal analysis:
Matlab/2024a (with signal processing toolbox)
