# Instructions
Raw image needs to be segmented and binarized before processing. Segmentation is recommended to be done using pixel classification in Ilastik <https://www.ilastik.org/>.
After processing, a terminal-only image will be created, which can be used for object classification in Ilastik.

An example binary image is provided in the import folder for testing purpose.
